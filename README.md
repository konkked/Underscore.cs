Underscore.cs
=============

Started out as a port of the open source JavaScript Library Underscore.js to C#,
but now is really a library (or helper object) inspired by Underscore.js.

Currently the documentation is sparse because I am not sure how much of it is going 
to change in the future so not worth investing heavily into it until things get a little
more stable
